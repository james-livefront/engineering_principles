# Roadmap

## Current Features

- ✅ AI-powered code review prompt generation
- ✅ Platform-specific standards (Android, iOS, Web)
- ✅ Security and accessibility detection rules
- ✅ Evaluation framework for measuring prompt effectiveness
- ✅ CLI tool for generating targeted prompts

## TODO - High Priority

### Missing Detection Rules

Several principles still lack detection/generation fragments:

- **Testing** - Coverage requirements, test quality checks
- **Documentation** - Missing README sections, API docs, inline comments
- **Dependencies** - Unapproved libraries, license compliance
- **Performance** - Bundle size, optimization opportunities

### Evaluation Improvements

- Expand test cases for edge scenarios
- Add regression tests for new principles
- Improve evaluation metrics (precision/recall per severity)

## Future Enhancements

### Integration Opportunities

- IDE assistants (VS Code extension)
- CI bot integration (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Pre-commit hooks automation
- Slack/Teams notifications for violations

### Community & Extensibility

- Template for other organizations to adapt
- Plugin system for custom rules
- Rule pack marketplace/sharing
- Documentation for contributing new principles

### Advanced Features

- Machine learning for violation pattern detection
- Historical trend analysis
- Team compliance dashboards
- Automated severity escalation
